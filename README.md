AI-Powered Credit Risk & Delinquency Management System

Developed an AI-powered Credit Risk & Delinquency Management System, leveraging Gradient Boosting and SHAP for transparent risk scoring. Designed a dynamic, risk-based collections workflow projected to reduce delinquency by 15–20% and optimize collection costs.




1. Data Diagnostics & Feature Engineering
I conducted a deep Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to ensure data integrity and identify high-impact risk factors.

Data Quality Assurance: Resolved missing payment history, inconsistent income formats, and extreme credit utilization outliers (>100%).

Key Risk Drivers Identified: High credit utilization (>70%), frequent late payments, and low income-to-credit ratio emerged as strong predictors of delinquency.




2. Predictive Model Development
I built a robust AI model to generate risk scores predicting delinquency probability.

Model Selection: Implemented a Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) (XGBoost/LightGBM) for high accuracy and ability to capture non-linear patterns.

Responsible AI: Integrated SHAP (SHapley Additive ExPlanations) for transparent, human-readable prediction explanations.

Evaluation & Fairness: Optimized using AUC and F1-Score, with Equalized Odds checks to ensure unbiased predictions across customer segments.




3. AI-Powered Collections Workflow
I designed a dynamic, risk-based collections system leveraging the predictive model for tailored interventions.

Risk-Based Segmentation: Low, medium, and high-risk customers receive customized actions, from automated reminders to human agent escalations.

Agentic AI Framework: Balanced autonomous AI for routine tasks with human oversight for complex decisions.

Expected Impact: Projected 15–20% reduction in delinquency and significant cost savings through automation.
