# AI-Powered-Credit-Risk-Delinquency-Management-System

1.Data Diagnostics & Feature Engineering
My process began with a deep Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to ensure data quality and identify powerful risk indicators.

Data Quality Assurance: I addressed critical issues like missing payment history, inconsistent income formats, and extreme outliers in credit utilization (over 100%).

Key Risk Drivers: I established strong predictors of delinquency, including High Credit Utilization (>70%), frequent late payments, and a low income-to-credit ratio.



2. Predictive Model Development
I developed a predictive model to output a risk score indicating the probability of a customer becoming delinquent.

Model Selection: I implemented a Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) (e.g., XGBoost/LightGBM), chosen for its superior ability to capture complex, non-linear relationships and deliver high predictive accuracy.

Responsible AI: I integrated SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to provide transparent, human-readable justifications for each prediction.

Evaluation: I used AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) as the primary metric and the F1-Score to balance precision and recall. I also conducted Fairness Checks using Equalized Odds to ensure the model did not unfairly penalize specific customer segments.




3. AI-Powered Collections Workflow
The predictive model feeds a dynamic collections system, enabling tailored customer interventions based on risk segmentation.

Risk-Based Interventions: Customers are segmented into low, medium, and high-risk groups to receive customized actions, from automated reminders to human agent escalations.

Agentic AI Framework: The system balances Autonomous AI for routine tasks like risk scoring and payment reminders with essential Human Oversight for complex cases and final approvals.

Expected Impact: The system is projected to reduce the delinquency rate by 15-20% and cut collection costs through automation.
